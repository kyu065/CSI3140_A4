 In order to implement and run these functions, 

DISCLAIMER:  These are all functions as followed on a 
windows (...)
 You need a couple of pre installed applications

 First you must have a valid php IDE, xampp and a
 postgresql server and database named clientdb 

An important part of this website is the connectivity and it's database
 Database. Make sure you have installed db preferably PostgreSQL. As the code in the current files are meant for a connection within a server db through Postgresql. 

 Install and make sure your
default username and password for postgresql is 
 User: postgre
 Password:superuser

 If your user name or password is different, you have to change the attribute value to support your credentials. 

the name of our database will be clientdb, if you wish to change to another name or support the data with another name, you may change 
the clientdb attribute in all the files. Preferrably however, it will be safe to use the default db names and simply create a database with the client db name. 
create a table named patients with the 3 attributes of name, severity and wait_time.

There is an example of queries in the database.sql file

Create a clientdb table within postgresql and make sure your server is running properly 
 To run xampp, 
 install xampp, 
 run the apache server for xampp 
 place the php folders and supporting documents/code inside 
 the htdocs directory under you folder installation of 
 xampp should be in your c drive by default, if else 
 search for it else where 

 We save our code all documents into the htdocs folder 

 Open up a browser, preferrably chrome on windows 

 open the localhost and type the specific directory of the files within the 
 code htdocs and its index.php 
E.g: If your file is in a  a/CSI3140_A4 directory you would type the following
 http://localhost/a/CSI3140_A4/index.php
